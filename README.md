A vertical phonemic writing system for French I designed and made into a computer font, so as to be able to write with it in programmes like Microsoft Word. 
I also made a python script to convert French texts to a phonetic transcription, then used by the custom font, as displayed in the short "paques.pdf" file. 
Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the file anymore, but I'll upload it here as soon as I find it.
